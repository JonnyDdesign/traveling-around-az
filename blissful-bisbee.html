    <p>Bisbee, Arizona is a town located in Cochise County in the southeastern part of the state. The area was first settled in the mid-1800s and was officially incorporated as a town in 1902. Bisbee has a long and colorful history as a copper mining town. In the early 1900s, the surrounding area was the largest copper producer in the US. During the height of the copper mining boom, Bisbee was home to over 20,000 people. The town reached its peak of population and prosperity in the late 1920s. The decline of the copper industry in the 1930s caused a sharp decline in the population and economy of Bisbee. After WWII, the town slowly began to redevelop as an artist and tourist attraction. In the 1970s, Bisbee was declared a National Historic Landmark and is now known for its galleries, festivals, and live music.</p>

      <h2>Copper, Copper, and More Copper</h2>
      <p>Bisbee, Arizona has a long and rich history with copper mining. Bisbee was founded in 1880 as a mining camp after large deposits of copper were discovered in the Mule Mountains. The copper industry quickly flourished, and by the early 1900s Bisbee was the largest city between St. Louis and San Francisco. The Copper Queen Mine was the largest and most productive mine in Bisbee, producing over 8 billion pounds of copper ore between 1880 and 1975. The copper industry in Bisbee created a strong economy and provided employment for thousands of people. Copper mining in Bisbee continued until the late 1970s when the last mine closed. The copper industry left a lasting impact on the city of Bisbee, and the area is now known as the 'Queen of the Copper Mines'.</p>

      <p>The new hot spot and number one dinner ticket in town is The Copper Pig. Although this newly minted, nine table dinner spot is only open Sunday through Wednesday, the restaurant has been packed since opening in 2014. Savory staples such as fried chicken and dumplings have been popular choices early on, but so have alternative choices such as jambalaya (with shrimp, chicken and house-made andouille sausage) and jägerschnitzel (a pork loin cutlet breaded with house-made bread crumbs, then finished with a mushroom cabernet sauce). The regular menu is accompanied by seasonal specials — October, for example, featured sauerbraten, potato pancakes and other German delicacies. There are dessert specials, too, such as lemon bread pudding and gluten-free chocolate cake.</p>
