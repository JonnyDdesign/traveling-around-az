      <h2>Mexican Crepe</h2>
      <p>Mexican crepes are an incredibly delicious and easy-to-make breakfast or snack. To make Mexican crepes, all you need is flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a pinch of salt. You can also add a variety of ingredients for flavor such as cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Start by combining the flour, eggs, milk, butter, and salt in a large bowl and whisking until everything is combined and you have a smooth batter.

Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet and spread it out in a thin circle, being careful not to spread it too thin. Cook for about 1 minute until the edges start to brown, then flip and cook for another minute until the other side is lightly browned. To serve, simply top with your favorite toppings such as whipped cream, fruit, or chocolate chips. Mexican crepes are a delicious and easy way to start the day off right and are sure to be a hit with your family and friends.

      <h2>Did Someone Say Chimichanga?</h2>
      <p>El Charro Cafe is widely considered to be the birthplace of the now famous chimichanga. As the story goes, Tia Monica Flin was busy frying her now famous El Charro ground beef tacos, when she accidentally dropped a burro into the frying pan. When the burro dropped in the pan, oil splashed everywhere and as she was about to lash out a common Spanish cuss word starting with “Ch” but because she was amongst her young nieces and nephews, changed it to “Chimichanga”, the equivalent of “thingamajig.”</p>
